This project is part of the research on the interactions between Earth's atmosphere and the instruments aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Specifically, the objective was to explore a specific and still under-researched phenomenon: the possible electromagnetic interference generated by storm clouds and their potential impact on the onboard magnetometers.

The initiative was born from winning a competition organized by the European Space Agency (ESA) for young students (AstroPi), which provided the opportunity to develop an advanced scientific software to collect and analyze data directly aboard the ISS. The software was designed to monitor the composition and density of clouds beneath the space station and correlate this information with magnetometer data. The ultimate goal was to identify any anomalies or interference in the magnetic field that could be attributed to the presence of storm clouds, thus verifying the hypothesis that such clouds might affect the onboard electromagnetic instruments.
